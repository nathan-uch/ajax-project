# ROAM - City Finder

A dynamic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript solo project.

## What is ROAM?
ROAM is an application for travel enthusiasts who want to create a list of cities they've been to.

Although I've traveled and lived in a few different countries, I know there are many places I've never been to but would enjoy exploring. This project allows me to find new places to travel and maybe even live in. I can also remember different trips I've had around the world.
